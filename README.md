Value of object stored as sequence of bits/data type of object tells compiler how to interpret bits, if value of one type stored in object of another type have to do conversion, can be implicit or explicit
Implicit type conversion performed automatically by compiler when one data type required/different type supplied (ex. int value stored in double variable), can be initial assignment/function return/parameter/etc., compiler does automatically if suitable conversion can be found, else fails with compile error
